# ðŸ«§ðŸ§´ Skincare Routine Tracker ðŸ§´ðŸ«§

## Welcome to my project! ##

> ### About my project: ###
> 
>> This application is a **skincare routine tracker**.
>> It lets you enter information about:
>> - The **current** skincare products you are using
>> - Skincare products you want to try in the **future**
>> - Skincare products you want to **avoid**
>
> Information entered for each product will include the type of product 
> (*i.e. purpose*), the brand, the product price, the frequency of usage, 
> and more. 
> 
> The application will track the userâ€™s current skincare routine 
> (*the order of products applied daily and weekly*), as well as statistics on
> the current skincare routine expenses, the most and least used products,
> and for how long each product was in use. Thus preventing users from forgetting
> which products they've already tried, which products they liked, and
> how much money they've spent on skincare to avoid spending more than they
> need to.

This application is for **anyone** that wants a way to keep track 
of their skincare routines. Many people, including myself, 
are constantly searching for a routine that works best for themselves. 
Not only do countless products exist, but skincare itself is expensive, 
and it can be discouraging for anyone struggling with their skin.

As such, I decided to make this project because it is an application 
that I, myself would use, and that many others can benefit from. 
With this application, I aim to make the skincare journey just a *bit* 
easier and fun for **everyone**.
